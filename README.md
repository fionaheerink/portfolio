# Fiona Heerink Data Science Portfolio 

Welcome! This portfolio serves as an overview of my data science projects.
My work focuses on statistical methods, applied machine learning, and NLP, 
with a strong interest in Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Featured Projects

### 1. Anomaly Detection in Global Burden of Disease Data
**Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, PCA  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Plotly  
**Data:** IHME Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2025 release

This project applies statistical and machine learning–based anomaly detection
methods to country-level cause-of-death profiles from the Global Burden of Disease
study. The goal is to identify countries with unusual mortality patterns and
demonstrate robust, interpretable anomaly detection approaches.

## Other Projects

### 2. Customer Segmentation with Clustering  
Techniques: Feature engineering, K-Means, elbow method, silhouette score, hierarchical clustering + dendrogram, PCA, t-SNE  
Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy  
Data: E-commerce transactions dataset

This project builds an end-to-end customer segmentation pipeline using unsupervised learning. I engineered customer-level behavioural features and compared multiple clustering validation methods to identify meaningful customer groups.

## More Projects (upcoming)

**I’m currently refining a few more projects, which I’ll be adding here soon:**

- **Predictive modelling (supervised learning)**  
  XGBoost and neural networks using StudyGroup data.

- **NLP topic modelling of customer reviews**  
  Topic modelling and insights from PureGym Group review data.

- **Time-series forecasting**  
  Sales and demand forecasting using Nielsen BookScan data.

- **Employer Project with Bank of England (NLP + RAG)**  
  Identifying language-based predictors of financial stress in the banking sector using unstructured transcript data, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
