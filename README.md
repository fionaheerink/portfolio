# Fiona Heerink Data Science Portfolio 

Welcome! This repository serves as an overview of my data science projects.
My work focuses on exploratory data analysis, anomaly detection, and applied
machine learning, with a special interest in health and social data.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Anomaly Detection in Global Burden of Disease Data
**Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, PCA  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Plotly  
**Data:** IHME Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2025 release

This project applies statistical and machine learning–based anomaly detection
methods to country-level cause-of-death profiles from the Global Burden of Disease
study. The goal is to identify countries with unusual mortality patterns and
demonstrate robust, interpretable anomaly detection approaches.

**More projects will be added as they are updated and refined:**

- **Customer segmentation & clustering**  
  Elbow method, silhouette score, hierarchical clustering + dendrograms, PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

- **Predictive modelling (supervised learning)**  
  XGBoost and neural networks using StudyGroup data.

- **NLP topic modelling of customer reviews**  
  Topic modelling and insights from PureGym Group review data.

- **Time-series forecasting**  
  Sales and demand forecasting using Nielsen BookScan data.

- **Employer Project with Bank of England (NLP + RAG)**  
  Identifying language-based predictors of financial stress in the banking sector using unstructured transcript data, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
